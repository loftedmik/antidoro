# üçÖAntiDoro

## About
**AntiDoro** is a pomodoro-like timer that helps you achieve flow state.

Inspired by [this redditor](https://pinterest.com/pin/568720259212083971/), I created an app that lets you work in dynamic duration sessions. If you choose e. g. the **3h** option, you first start with **50 minutes** of work, then **10 minutes** rest, then 40 minutes of work, then 10 minutes of rest and so on till you reach the last 10 minutes working session, so your whole time is split like that: **50**/10/**40**/10/**30**/10/**20**/10/**10** (190 min in total). With this technique, you are able to do **solid 2,5h** of deep work in roughly **3h**! *(without procrastinating or feeling guilty)*.

## Why not Pomodoro?
While working in classic 25/5 pomodoro rhythm, you make pauses too often and quit your flow state too often. With **AntiDoro**, you start off with a long working session, but it becomes shorter with time to ensure your efficiency and focus stay stable.
